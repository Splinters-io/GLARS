      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Geo-Legal Access Risk Score (GLARS) framework provides an objective, apolitical methodology for assessing and quantifying jurisdictional risks related to data sovereignty. This helps organizations make informed decisions about where to store, process, and transfer sensitive data.</p>

      <h2>Note from the Author</h2>
      <div class="author-note">
        <p>Legal jurisdictions will always impose requirements on data. GLARS isn't about avoiding these realities or just generating a numerical score—it's about creating transparency around risks that materially impact both data custodians and owners.</p>
        <p>The critical question: What happens when your data is lawfully accessed? Can you architect systems that require explicit access requests, giving you visibility into access attempts? Or must you accept that data stored in certain jurisdictions may be silently accessed by authorized entities without your knowledge?</p>
        <p>True data sovereignty isn't about perfect security—it's about informed risk management.</p>
